# Introduction

`systemg` is a simple, lightweight, fast alternative to systemd, designed for
developers and operators who want simplicity without sacrificing power and features.
Out of the box, `systemg` can start, stop, restart, and monitor processes, trigger
webhooks on lifecycle events, and schedule recurring workloads with cron-like
semantics.
