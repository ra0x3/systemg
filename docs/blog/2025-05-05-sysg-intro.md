Systemg is a new approach to program composition: transforming arbitrary programs into coherent systems with explicit lifecycles, dependencies, and health monitoring.

Instead of managing individual daemons, Systemg focuses on:

- **Composition over mechanics**: Declare how programs work together as a system
- **Explicit lifecycles**: Define startup sequences, health checks, and recovery behaviors
- **Built-in deployment strategies**: Rolling deployments with health validation included

Perfect for developers who need to compose programs into predictable, evolvable systems.
