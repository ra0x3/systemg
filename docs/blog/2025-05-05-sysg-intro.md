Systemg is a new take on an old problem: how do we reliably run and manage background services â€” without depending on an entire operating system suite?

Unlike systemd, Systemg is:

- **Minimal**: no bloat, no DBus.
- **Rust-powered**: safe, fast, efficient.
- **Configuration-first**: human-readable YAML.

Perfect for developers who want sane defaults and simple commands.
